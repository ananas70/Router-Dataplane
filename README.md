  In this project, I implemented the dataplane component of a router, focusing on optimizing routing processes through sorting routing tables and performing binary searches for efficient routing. I developed functionalities for handling IPv4 packets, which included support for ICMP and ARP protocols. Additionally, I managed the forwarding of packets based on static routing tables and interface handling, ensuring smooth and efficient data transmission. The implementation was carried out using C, which enhanced my understanding of network protocols and data structures.
  Technical details regarding the source code can be found in the Readme1 file.
